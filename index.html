                <p>This night is cold in the kingdom <br>
                    I can feel you fade away <br>
                    From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and <br>
                    Your steps keep me awake <br>
                    <!-- [Pre-Chorus] <br> -->
                    Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste <br>
                    I once was a man with dignity and grace <br>
                    Now I'm slippin' through the cracks of your cold embrace
                    <br></p>

                    Could you find a way to let me down slowly?<br>
                    A little sympathy, I hope you can show me <br>
                    If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely <br>
                    If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly <br>

                    Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile <br>
                    As I'm walking down the corridor <br>
                    And I know we haven't talked in a while <br>
                    So I'm looking for an open door <br>
